/*
 * main.jsx - React Application Entry Point & Bootstrap Configuration
 * 
 * BUSINESS IMPACT: This file serves as the critical foundation that transforms static HTML
 * into a dynamic, interactive portfolio experience. The clean, modern React bootstrapping
 * approach demonstrates adherence to current industry standards and best practices,
 * showing employers that you understand production-ready application architecture.
 * 
 * TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE SIGNIFICANCE:
 * - Modern React 18+ concurrent rendering features for optimal performance
 * - Clean separation of concerns between application logic and bootstrap configuration
 * - Production-ready entry point structure that scales for enterprise applications
 * - Efficient CSS import strategy ensuring styles load before component rendering
 * - Minimal, focused implementation that avoids unnecessary complexity
 * 
 * EMPLOYER VALUE DEMONSTRATION:
 * - React Ecosystem Mastery: Uses latest React 18+ createRoot API for concurrent features
 * - Performance Consciousness: Optimal render method selection for modern browsers
 * - Professional Standards: Clean, readable code structure that facilitates team collaboration
 * - Best Practices: Follows official React documentation recommendations
 * - Production Readiness: Structure supports easy integration with build tools and deployment
 * - Framework Currency: Demonstrates knowledge of current React patterns and methodologies

/*
 * REACT 18+ CREATEROOT IMPORT - Modern concurrent rendering API
 * PERFORMANCE ADVANTAGE: createRoot enables React 18's concurrent features including:
 * - Automatic batching for better performance
 * - Suspense integration for loading states
 * - startTransition for non-urgent updates
 * - Time slicing for better user experience during heavy computations
 * 
 * TECHNICAL EVOLUTION: Replaces legacy ReactDOM.render() with modern API
 * FUTURE-PROOFING: Ensures compatibility with upcoming React features
 * INDUSTRY ALIGNMENT: Follows current React team recommendations and best practices
 */

/*
 * GLOBAL STYLES IMPORT - Strategic CSS loading order
 * TIMING STRATEGY: Imports CSS before App component to ensure styles are available during initial render
 * PERFORMANCE: Prevents Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) during application initialization
 * ARCHITECTURE: Global styles include Tailwind framework + custom brand styling
 * MAINTAINABILITY: Centralized style management through single entry point
 * 
 * STYLE SYSTEM INCLUDES:
 * - Tailwind CSS utility framework for rapid, consistent styling
 * - Custom brand identity CSS (teal color scheme, animations, cursors)
 * - Cross-browser scrollbar customization and accessibility enhancements
 * - Performance-optimized animations and micro-interactions

/*
 * ROOT APP COMPONENT IMPORT - Application architecture entry point
 * COMPONENT HIERARCHY: App.jsx orchestrates all portfolio sections and user journey
 * SEPARATION OF CONCERNS: Bootstrap logic separated from application logic
 * SCALABILITY: Clean import structure supports easy testing and development workflows
 * MAINTAINABILITY: Single root component simplifies debugging and performance monitoring

/*
 * REACT APPLICATION INITIALIZATION - Modern bootstrap implementation
 * 
 * CREATEROOT CONFIGURATION:
 * - document.getElementById('root'): Targets HTML mount point for React application
 * - Modern API provides access to React 18+ concurrent features
 * - Automatic error boundary integration for production stability
 * - Enhanced developer experience with better error messages and warnings
 * 
 * RENDER STRATEGY:
 * - Direct App component rendering without wrapper components
 * - Clean, minimal structure reduces unnecessary DOM nesting
 * - Optimal for single-page applications and portfolio presentations
 * - Efficient rendering pipeline for immediate user engagement
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:
 * - Concurrent rendering enables non-blocking user interactions
 * - Automatic batching reduces unnecessary re-renders
 * - Optimized for modern browsers with graceful degradation
 * - Minimal JavaScript bundle size for fast initial load times
